How to back up database (postgres) automatically at 2am in the morning and 
store it in a remote location like AWS s3 bucket storage
database name test1
database user test1
database password test




There is no real experience with this process. But i knew it was using a python module called boto3, which handles task related to python and amazon webservices.


While googling I found another method to do this above mentioned task by using a django library called django-dbbackup.
This library help to create the database backup and it can be then uploaded the s3bucket by using any scheduler library for python, similar to  django-cron. Thus the database will be automatically backed up at the specified time.
