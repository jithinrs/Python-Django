 How to create a bundles of static files like css,js and images. And this static file should be minified when creating a bundle of it using webpack.




 I am quite confused on how to answer the question 2 and 3.

 One way to bundle all the static files, is by manually create a static folder in teh root folder and put the source of it in the settings.py.
 Another method is using 'collectstatic' method. This way, django automatically collect all the static files(images, css, js) and put into a folder in the root area.
 Either way we have to put the reference of static folder in the settings.py

STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),
]


About the second part of the question. I am not quite familiar with webpack.
